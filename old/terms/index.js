        <p>Mintdropz Terms of Use Last Revised: August 6th, 2021</p>
      </div>
      <h1>1.Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Mintdropz!</p>
      <p>
        <b>1.1 Read this.</b> Thank you for using the Mintdropz Platform and the
        products, services, software, and features We make available to You as
        part of the Platform (Collectively, the “Service(s)”). This Terms of Use
        agreement (” Terms of Use,” “Terms,” or “Agreement”) is intended to be a
        binding legal agreement between you, the User (“You,” “Your,” or
        “User(s)”) and Mintdropz, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“Mintdropz,”
        “We,” “Us,” “Ours”,“Mintdropz.com”). By using the Service and/or
        Mintdropz.com (“Site,” “Website,” or “Platform), You are agreeing to the
        following Terms of Use whether or not you have registered on the
        Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mintdropz reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time
        and at our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will
        provide notice of such changes, such as updating the “Last Updated” date
        at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the
        Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the
        terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the
        Terms frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions
        that apply when you access or use the Service. If you do not agree to
        the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1.2 Our Service.</b> The Service allows You to use fiat currency
        (such as US dollars) or Cryptocurrency to upload digital Content to the
        Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Mint a ERZC-721 non-fungible token
        (“NFT”) that, along with Your non-custodial Wallet, records ownership of
        the uploaded Content on a blockchain. NFTs contain a reference to where
        Your digital Content resides on IPFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service empowers You to own Your own Smart Contract, which means You
        control the future actions of Your digital Content and the associated
        NFT (i.e. resale, royalties, Burning, etc) and You can access Your
        digital Content without Our involvement. The owner of a Smart Contract
        (“Collection Owner”) can invite others to Mint into their Smart Contract
        (“Collection”) and payments can be made to multiple Wallets if
        associated with the Collection. Ultimately, the Service gives You
        control of Your brand.
      </p>
      <p>The Service includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(A) Own your own Collection (sometimes called “White Label”)</li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This service is a bi-annual, exclusive release agreement between
              Mintdropz and the creator. Any NFT releases outside of Mintdropz
              by a Mintdropz are subject to approval by Mintdropz’s sole
              discretion
            </li>
            <li>
              The Service empowers You to set your own fees and rules on Your
              Smart Contract and to invite others to Mint into Your Collection.
              Once you purchase Your Collection, depending on Your subscription,
              You may then purchase Credits to upload Content and Mint NFTs into
              Your Collection, or Minting may be included in Your subscription
              (We reserve the right to change subscriptions at any time). You
              can set the percentage of each sale you keep and the percentage
              others in Your Collection receive – on Primary Sales sold on the
              Platform. Notably, We cannot and do not control other marketplaces
              so if You sell Your NFT on another marketplace (for example, Open
              Sea or Rarible, among others) we do not control who is paid, how
              they are paid, or how much they are paid. If Our Service sounds
              great, it is best to sell Your NFT on Our Platform to ensure Your
              Payouts are as You requested.
            </li>
            <li>
              If You take Your NFT minted on the Platform to another website to
              attempt to or actually sell Your NFT, You are able to and are
              solely responsible for, telling that website any payments and/or
              royalties You wish to receive as a result of the sale. As
              mentioned, We only control payments that are sold on Our Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to comply with agreement, Mintdropz must be mentioned in
              press releases, statements, and social media posts surrounding nft
              collection releases on and off the platform
            </li>
            <li>(B) Multiple blockchain options to Mint on to</li>
            <li>
              (C) Mint and be paid in fiat currency (i.e. US Dollars) OR choose
              to Mint and be paid in one Cryptocurrency.
            </li>
            <li>
              We want to empower You. As such We want to remind You of the
              possible capital gains taxation that may occur when You use
              cryptocurrency to buy and/or sell NFTs..
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(D) A storefront to sell Your NFTs</li>
        <li>
          (E) Use Our Application Programming Interface (API) in Your own
          applications
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contact Us if you wish to integrate Our API and we can discuss
              further details, scope and cost of an agreement, and how We can
              help You.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Service facilitates Your Transactions and does not maintain or store
        your digital Content, Your NFTs, or Your personal information.

      </p>
      <h1>3. Ownership, License, and restrictions</h1>
      <p>
        <b>3.1</b> Creator rights, digital Content. When You upload digital
        Content that aligns with these Terms of Use, Mint and sell your NFT in
        Mintdropz.COM, You retain the following copyright rights of your digital
        Content: the right to 1) reproduce the copyrighted work, 2) prepare
        derivative works based on the copyright, 3) distribute copies and 4) in
        the case of literary, musical, dramatic, choreographic and other
        audiovisual works, perform or display the copyrighted work publicly.
        Additionally, Creator’s retain any trademark to digital Content, if the
        Creator owns the copyright in the first place. Remember, You are
        prohibited from uploading digital Content you do not own the copyright
        to, unless you have shown Us, in writing, the express permission granted
        to You to use another’s copyrighted work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creator’s agree to license the rights to: 1) copy the digital Content
        version associated with the NFT and 2) display the digital Content
        connected to a NFT on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creator rights, NFT.</b> When You upload digital Content, as
        mentioned in 3.1, and Mint an associated NFT, You give the Purchaser a
        license to that copy of the digital Content version and to transfer the
        NFT.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.2 Collection Owner rights.</b> NFTs are not ownership of the
        digital Content itself. Digital Content uploaded is stored on the
        Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and if the User who uploaded the
        digital Content owned the copyright to that digital content, they will
        continue to own the portions of trademark and copyright (in section 3.1)
        to the digital Content even after the NFT is transferred. A Collection
        Owner owns the Smart Contract associated with the Collection, but does
        not own any digital Content or the associated NFT that are linked to the
        Smart Contract, unless the Collection Owner is also a Creator and Minted
        into the Smart Contract. However, as a Smart Contract owner, the
        Collection Owner has the right to Burn NFTs in their Collection and the
        right to set primary and secondary sale percentages on marketplaces
        other than Mintdropz.com that have those capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> 3.2 What a NFT Purchaser Owns.</b> An NFT Purchaser does not own the
        digital Content, instead the Purchaser has a license to a copy the
        digital Content version associated with the NFT and 2) a license to
        display the digital Content connected to a NFT on social media, as
        licensed by the Creator above. Purchasers of an NFT on Mintdropz have
        the right to trade the NFT, sell it, or give it away when they choose,
        unless a separate agreement is made between buyer and seller. However,
        please know that the Collection Owner may be able to control portions of
        the Smart Contract, as is true with any Smart Contract on any platform.
        (See section 3.2)
      </p>
      <p>
        An NFT Purchaser or an owner after an NFT has been transferred cannot
        reproduce any additional verified copies for a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.3 Transfer of NFT:</b> Rights in sections 3.1-3.3 associated with
        the NFT and/or associated digital Content are transferred if and when
        the NFT is transferred, with the exception of the trademark and
        copyrights retained by the Creator of digital Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.4 Rights only for Primary Sales on Mintdropz.COM.</b> Sections 3.1
        – 3.3 only apply when an NFT is Minted and sold on Mintdropz.com for the
        primary sale. If an NFT is sold on another marketplace, Mintdropz has NO
        control over the rights, license, or assignment of Your NFT or digital
        Content.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to: your
          access, use, or attempted access or use of the Platform and/or
          Services; any products and/or Services sold or distributed through the
          Platform; or any aspect of your relationship with Mintdropz will be
          resolved by binding arbitration, except that (1) you may assert claims
          in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Mintdropz
          may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of
          intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain
          names, trade secrets, copyright, or patent). You agree that any such
          arbitration shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding
          arbitration held in San Diego, California, administered by JAMS and
          conducted in English, rather than in court.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
          then-prevailing JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures,
          except that any dispute involving claims and counterclaims over
          $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be

          and Procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (1) determine the

          resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability,
          enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including
          but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration
          Agreement is void or voidable; (3) decide the rights and liabilities,
          if any, of You and Mintdropz; (4) grant motions dispositive of all or

          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
